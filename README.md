### Project Overview
---
This Data Analysis project aims to extract valuable insights and knowlegde from data to enhance decision-making, optimize processes and drive business growth, through various techniques including visualization, summary statistics and frequency distribution.   
### Data Sources
---
The primary source of Data used here is Data Sale.csv and this is an open source data than can be freely downloaded from an open source online such as Kaggle or FRED or any other data repository site. 

### Tools Used
---

### Data Cleaning and Preparations
---
In the initial phase of the Data cleaning and preparations, we performed the following actions;
  1.	Data loading and inspection
  2.	Handling missing variables 
  3.	Data Cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis
---
EDA involved the exploring of the Data to answer some questions about the Data such as;
-	What is the overall sales trend?
-	Which products or regions are top sellers?
-	What are the products on peak sales? 

### Data Analysis
---
This is where we included some basic lines of code or queries or even some of the DAX expressions used during the analysis;

```SQL
SELECT * FROM TABLE1
WHERE CONDITION = TRUE
```

### Data Visualization
